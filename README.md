# Implementation of Raft Consensus Algorithm in Kotlin using Akka.

Running the command “grade build”
in the root directory where the build.gradle file lives, will build
a jar file in “./builds/libs” that can be run with
“java -jar .\build\libs\Raft-1.0.jar”. In order to change the number
of actors the script runs with, modify the variable in main called
“numActors”. Currently set to 7.

No other sources outside the ones mentioned above were consulted.
